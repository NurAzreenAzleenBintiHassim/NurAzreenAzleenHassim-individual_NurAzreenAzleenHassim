			<p style="text-align:justify";>In 2008 I started my first year in elementary school. I went to school at a rather 
				famous school called Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Kerian, which was established in 1877 as Sekolah Melayu Parit Buntar. 
				This school is one of the schools that obtained very excellent results in the UPSR examination. The school is a bit 
				far from my house however I go and come back to school sent by my family members. I went to school there for six years 
				from 2008 to 2013. I learned a lot of new knowledge and made many new friends who came from various places. It gave me 
				many sweet memories and important life lessons. I was also a Resource Center Supervisor for three years and I had to run 
				errands twice a week during breaks at the school resource center. In 2013 I took the UPSR exam and obtained a result of 3A 2B.</p>

				are two afternoon and morning school sessions. Due to my good UPSR results I was placed 
				in the morning session school in the Special Plan class where this class has an Arabic 
				language class that must be taken by all who enter the class up to form 3. In 2017 I have 
				to choose the form 4 class stream available in my school . In my school there are seven streams 
				namely science, account, religion, technique, literature, vocational and art. I chose the technique 
				class because I wanted to study the subject of engineering drawing. I took the class until I was in 
				Form 5 in 2018. At that time I took a very important exam, SPM.</p>

			<br>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">In 2019, I did some 
					climbing activities for the first time. The hill that 
					is my choice to climb with my friends is Bukit Limau which 
					is located in Permatang Kerat Telunjuk, Bandar Baharu, Kedah. 
					Although it is quite difficult to find Bukit Limau because it 
					is located in the interior but it is very worth it. This is because 
					the cozy atmosphere and natural beauty that is on the hill is very 
					beautiful. Bukit Limau got its name because it is surrounded and along 
					the way to climb the hill there will be various types of lime trees such as 
					Limau Nipis, Limau Kasturi, Limau Purut and many more. This experience is something 
					new for me and I hope I can do this activity again in the future.</p>

				camp lasted for 2 days and 1 night at Hotel Casuarina and Kledang Saiong 
				Forest Eco Park. We had the opportunity to meet the Perak minister and the 
				environment minister face to face, this was a very meaningful opportunity 
				for me. This camp gathers all students who come from various universities 
				and polytechnics throughout Malaysia. Throughout the camp we learned 7 water 
				-related learning modules. Each module will be guided by speakers coming from 
				various water-related agencies.</p>

				a behind -the -scenes crew, where we were tasked to ensure all agendas 
				ran smoothly and manage the group of spectators from schools near UiTM 
				who were present to watch this theater. This experience is one that I will 
				never forget in a lifetime, this is because it is one of the rare experiences 
				I will participate in. I also met many new friends who came from various courses and semesters.</p>
